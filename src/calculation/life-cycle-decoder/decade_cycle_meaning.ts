  大命: { 
    紫微: "In the first five years of this 10 year cycle, Zi Wei leans on AUTHORITY and REPUTATION FIRST to shape identity through small, steady choices. Strategize with simple planning you can repeat: name one outcome for the day, narrow options to two and decide within ten minutes, track two basics such as sleep hours and weekly things finished, and run a short weekly review to reset priorities. Keep a basic spending log and one 20 minute focus block with notifications off. The caution is using POWER to control; state ownership and timelines, then step back so momentum is shared.", 
    破军: "Early in this 10 year cycle, Po Jun brings REBELLIOUS energy that favors clean slates; use it to strategize with planning rather than chaos. Archive old files, cancel stale commitments, and schedule a monthly reset where you decide what to stop, start, and continue. Keep a two step rule for changes: write the first step and the safety check before moving. Track sleep and steps to prevent burnout from DESTRUCTION mode. The caution is wrecking what still works; test on a small scale before you BREAK & REBUILD LATER.", 
    天府: "This 10 year cycle opens with Tian Fu’s STABILITY and TRADITIONAL rhythm; identity grows from calm accumulation. Strategize through quiet planning: set automatic weekly transfers to savings, define a fixed wake and wind down window, prepare simple meals ahead, and keep a one page budget that lists only income, essentials, and caps. Run a Sunday review to adjust gently rather than react. The caution is settling into inertia; add a monthly stretch habit so ACCUMULATIVE WEALTH is paired with steady growth in skills and health.", 
    廉贞: "With Lian Zhen, the first half of the 10 year cycle rewards DISCIPLINED habits and STRUCTURED routines. Strategize via planning that becomes your SOP: a morning checklist, a 20 minute focused block, and a nightly shutdown ritual that notes the top task for tomorrow. Use a simple tracker for hydration, movement, and spending to keep SYSTEMATIC awareness. Review weekly to prune non essentials. The caution is rigidity; allow one open hour for spontaneity so structure serves life instead of running it.", 
    太阴: "At the start of this 10 year cycle, Tai Yin guides identity through EMOTIONAL hygiene and BEAUTY in daily space. Strategize with gentle planning: tidy for ten minutes after meals, keep a mood or gratitude log, and set a weekly quiet hour without screens to let feelings settle. Maintain a basic budget for home and PROPERTY upkeep and protect a consistent sleep window. The caution is people pleasing; name one boundary for availability each day so care includes you and your energy remains steady.", 
    贪狼: "In the first half of this 10 year cycle, Tan Lang amplifies CHARISMA and DESIRE; identity expands through honest expression. Strategize using planning that channels appetite into creation: schedule a 20 minute daily creative block, give luxury a budget envelope, and cap social commitments to nights that support rest. Track mood alongside screen time to spot drains. The caution is overindulgence; keep a weekly review that asks whether EXPRESSIVE effort produced something you value and tighten limits when it does not.", 
    巨门: "Early in this 10 year cycle, Ju Men sharpens PERSUASIVE voice and sensitivity to the HIDDEN; identity is shaped by what you say and what you refrain from saying. Strategize with planning for clean communication: keep a five sentence daily journal, ask one clarifying question before reacting, and use a three line summary after serious talks. Schedule a weekly no complaint day to reset tone. The caution is becoming SHARP TONGUED; when emotions spike, pause ten minutes and write before you speak.", 
    天同: "The opening of this 10 year cycle with Tian Tong centers HARMONY and the CHILDLIKE STAR; identity brightens through simple joy. Strategize via planning that protects lightness: a short walk or stretch daily, a small play block, and a kindness micro action you can do in minutes. Keep evenings calm with a wind down routine and track sleep and hydration. The caution is avoiding hard conversations; set a weekly slot to address one small tension so HAPPY GO LUCKY energy stays real, not avoidant.", 
    天相: "At the start of this 10 year cycle, Tian Xiang highlights DIPLOMATIC balance and JUSTICE; identity matures through fair dealing. Strategize with planning that keeps peace practical: use a two column decision sheet listing pros and cons, summarize agreements in a few lines, and set a weekly reflection on where you acted as a TEAM PLAYER. Maintain one tech free meal daily to listen better. The caution is indecision; if choices linger beyond a day, reduce to two options and decide on a set timer.", 
    武曲: "This 10 year cycle begins with Wu Qu’s BIG WEALTH STAR ethos; identity is built through BRAVE precision in small numbers. Strategize through planning that you can measure: track sleep and spending, set a 12 month emergency buffer target with tiny weekly transfers, and run a ten minute Friday review to reconcile inflow and outflow. Use a 20 minute focus block to finish one task completely. The caution is becoming too rigid; make room for rest so PRECISION does not turn into harshness.", 
    天梁: "In the first half of this 10 year cycle, Tian Liang leans on WISDOM and LONGEVITY; identity grows as an OLD SOUL THINKER who steadies others. Strategize with planning that preserves health and perspective: schedule annual checkups, set a weekly reading hour, and keep a simple notes file of lessons learned. Offer one small act of support each week without overcommitting. The caution is over caretaking; write thresholds for time and energy so your protection also protects you.", 
    太阳: "Early in this 10 year cycle, Tai Yang energizes POSITIVE drive and GENEROUS spirit; identity shines through daily consistency. Strategize via planning that anchors vitality: morning light exposure, a short movement routine, one deliberate act of generosity, and a weekly review that celebrates progress. Keep a simple bedtime window to protect PASSION from burnout. The caution is doing too much for others; commit to one promise fewer than you think you can handle so your light stays steady.", 
    七杀: "With Qi Sha, the first half of this 10 year cycle favors SHARP action and BOLD focus; identity strengthens when risk is sized wisely. Strategize using planning that tames speed: define stop rules before you start, use a 2x2 to rank impact and risk, and complete one hard task before noon. Keep a ten minute prep ritual to THINK FAST ACT FAST without being reckless. The caution is chasing noise; reduce inputs and stick to the plan for a full week before changing course.", 
    天机: "This 10 year cycle opens under Tian Ji, the BRAIN STAR of SMART THINKING and MOVEMENT; identity evolves through curiosity in motion. Strategize with planning that captures and tests ideas: keep a pocket note system, run one small experiment weekly, and reserve a 20 minute learning block daily. Track sleep and a single focus metric so energy matches ambition. The caution is overthinking; set a ten minute decision limit once the top two options are clear and act.", 
    左辅: "In the first half of this 10 year cycle, Zuo Fu highlights SUPPORTER strength and the NOBLE MAN who lifts others quietly. Strategize with planning that makes help sustainable: keep a simple request queue, protect a daily 20 minute focus block for your own priorities, and set a weekly boundary review to prevent overload. Record one lesson you learned while assisting. The caution is becoming the BOSS SECOND HAND at the cost of self care; say no to one extra ask each week.", 
    右弼: "Early in this 10 year cycle, You Bi refines supportive identity through steady partnership; qualities of SUPPORTER and NOBLE MAN shape your presence. Strategize with planning that shares load fairly: use a shared checklist for joint tasks at home, schedule a weekly check in with a trusted peer, and keep a simple gratitude note for collaboration. Protect one hour for personal goals. The caution is over rescuing; ask what is truly needed before you step in so support empowers.", 
    文昌: "At the start of this 10 year cycle, Wen Chang strengthens ACADEMIC clarity and DOCUMENTATION; identity benefits from writing things down. Strategize through planning that lives on paper: maintain a daily notes page, summarize key lessons weekly, and outline the next day in three lines before sleep. Keep a tiny reading target and track completion. The caution is perfection; ship rough notes so INTELLIGENCE and TALENTED effort turn into useful records.", 
    文曲: "In the first half of this 10 year cycle, Wen Qu blends ACADEMIC insight with creative flow; identity clarifies when ideas are captured and refined. Strategize with planning that keeps words moving: a 15 minute journaling habit, a weekly digest of what you learned, and a simple kanban with just three columns to see progress. Pair reading with a short summary to lock retention. The caution is elegant procrastination; bias toward finishing with good enough and iterate later." 
  },

  大兄: { 
    紫微: "As this 10 year cycle begins, Zi Wei brings AUTHORITY and REPUTATION FIRST into everyday peer life, so you set tone more than you notice; strategize with steady planning by agreeing simple group norms, keeping a shared calendar for key dates, running three short check ins a week by message, and using two option decisions on small choices to avoid drift. Keep one gratitude note to a sibling or friend each week and track how many joint tasks actually finish. The caution is sliding into CONTROLLING behavior; name the owner and a time box, then step back so trust grows.", 
    破军: "At the outset of your 10 year cycle, Po Jun adds REBELLIOUS reset energy to your circles; strategize with calm planning by archiving dead group chats, ending stale commitments, and scheduling a monthly reset where the group stops one habit, starts one, and continues one. Use a two step rule for changes write the first step and the safety check before moving, and keep a short list of bridges to protect so DESTRUCTION does not go too far. The caution is burning what still works; test small before you BREAK & REBUILD LATER.", 
    天府: "In the opening stretch of the 10 year cycle, Tian Fu steadies peers with STABILITY and TRADITIONAL rhythm; strategize gentle planning through reliable rituals like a weekly shared meal, a fixed check in window, and a simple pooled essentials list so small costs and chores stay fair. Keep a one page budget for shared expenses and track only totals to reduce friction. The caution is sinking into inertia; add one rotating host duty or walk together weekly so ACCUMULATIVE WEALTH includes time and trust.", 
    廉贞: "Early on in this 10 year cycle, Lian Zhen favors DISCIPLINED, STRUCTURED ties; strategize with practical planning by setting an SOP for how your group decides, shares costs, and closes loops. Use a three line agenda before any meet up, a two minute recap after, and a shared checklist that shows handoffs. Run a weekly prune of chats and tasks to stay SYSTEMATIC. The caution is rigidity that drains warmth; keep one open hour for unplanned connection.", 
    太阴: "With the 10 year cycle just starting, Tai Yin softens the field with BEAUTY and EMOTIONAL care; strategize respectful planning by creating calm spaces for conversation, keeping a mood or gratitude log, and hosting low sensory gatherings that feel safe. Protect sleep windows before big days and keep property like shared items tidy to reduce friction. The caution is people pleasing; set one clear boundary for availability so care includes you.", 
    贪狼: "Entering the 10 year cycle, Tan Lang amplifies CHARISMA and DESIRE within friendships; strategize with clear planning by curating simple, expressive meetups, giving LUXURY a small preset budget, and capping late nights to protect next day energy. Track screen time around social windows and choose quality over volume. The caution is overindulgence or drama; review weekly whether EXPRESSIVE time left you better or just busy and adjust limits.", 
    巨门: "Across the first phase of the 10 year cycle, Ju Men sharpens PERSUASIVE speech and awareness of the HIDDEN in group dynamics; strategize clean planning for talk by using a five sentence daily journal, asking one clarifying question before reacting, and paraphrasing agreements in three lines. Set a ten minute pause rule when heated to avoid SHARP TONGUED replies. The caution is quiet gossip; keep concerns in the open with compassion.",

Keep a simple wind down window and a weekly whisper list of friends to check on. The caution is avoiding hard topics; schedule one small, honest talk each week so HAPPY GO LUCKY stays real.", 
    天相: "As the 10 year cycle gets underway, Tian Xiang elevates DIPLOMATIC fairness and TEAM PLAYER spirit; strategize balanced planning by using a two column pros and cons sheet for group choices, standardizing how you split costs, and closing each discussion with a one line decision. Hold one tech free meal weekly to listen well. The caution is indecision in the name of JUSTICE; reduce options to two and choose on a set timer.", 
    武曲: "In the initial phase of the 10 year cycle, Wu Qu brings BRAVE PRECISION from the BIG WEALTH STAR into logistics with peers; strategize measurable planning by tracking shared expenses, using clear deadlines for joint tasks, and keeping a tiny ledger of favors returned so goodwill compounds. Set a weekly ten minute reconciliation and one 20 minute focus block to finish something for the group. The caution is coming off harsh; pair precision with warmth.", 
    天梁: "Beginning this 10 year cycle, Tian Liang adds WISDOM and LONGEVITY to friendships; strategize steady planning by keeping a weekly listening slot, rotating mentor style chats, and noting lessons learned in a simple file.

The caution is overgiving; commit to one promise fewer than you think you can keep.",
