export const EXECUTION_STYLE_DESCRIPTION: JSONObject = {
  "Commander": "You operate as a Commander: crisp decisions, visible cadence, zero drift. You convert strategy into sprints, set check-in rhythms, and make ownership unambiguous. Colleagues read your scoreboard and understand what â€˜doneâ€™ means, because you define acceptance criteria and close loops fast. You tend to decide early, narrow scope, and protect momentum under pressure. This discipline delivers results, especially in deadline-heavy work. Watchouts: bulldozing discovery or muting dissent. Build a short â€˜challenge the planâ€™ window, run quick pre-mortems, and calibrate risk before locking the route. You lead best where pace, structure, and accountability matter.",
  "Architect": "You operate as an Architect: measured, exacting, clarity-first. You design systems before speed, mapping flows, interfaces, and failure modes so teams build once, not twice. Documentation, quality gates, and versioned standards are your leverage; you prevent rework and create scale. You tend to front-load discovery, test assumptions early, and make trade-offs explicit. This steadiness suits regulated, complex, or long-horizon work. Watchouts: slow starts and analysis drag. Timebox investigation, define â€˜good enoughâ€™ thresholds, prototype to de-risk, and set decision windows so progress compounds while quality stays high.",
  "Catalyst": "You operate as a Catalyst: fast, flexible, momentum-hungry. You spark experiments, recruit allies, and turn small wins into a narrative that moves people. You prefer shipping a scrappy v1, gathering live signal, and iterating in tight loops. You tend to unblock with influence, connect dots across teams, and keep energy high when others stall. This bias accelerates launches and change initiatives. Watchouts: inconsistency, mess, and unmanaged exposure. Add simple guardrailsâ€”budgets, stop-rules, ownersâ€”so bets stay contained. Broadcast learning openly and codify what works so sparks become repeatable systems.",
  "Integrator": "You operate as an Integrator: collaborative, adaptive, steady under complexity. You connect contexts, translate aims between functions, and shape shared routines that let diverse people do great work together. Discovery and co-design are your starting moves; you surface dissent early and help the group decide well. You tend to resolve friction, negotiate interfaces, and sustain progress through rituals and follow-through. This style shines in cross-silo programs and partnership-heavy work. Watchouts: soft boundaries and slow decisions. Define authority, escalation paths, and decision windows upfront so harmony does not dilute accountability."
};

export const EXECUTION_STYLE_LEADERSHIP: JSONObject = {
  "Commander": "Lead with cadence and clarity. Set weekly targets, daily signals, and a visible scoreboard. Define 'done' with acceptance criteria, owners, and SLA-like timelines. Protect deep-work blocks, triage scope, and remove blockers quickly. Invite dissent before committing; run pre-mortems on critical bets. Your edge: speed with disciplineâ€”use guardrails, not micromanagement, to keep pace high and quality reliable.",
  "Architect": "Lead by design and documentation. Start with a written architecture brief, interfaces, and service levels. Establish stage gates, review checklists, and test thresholds before spend scales. Timebox discovery, prototype risky components, and publish decision logs people can trust. Coach teams to write, version, and refactor their standards. Your edge: reliability at scaleâ€”systems that make good choices the default.",
  "Catalyst": "Lead through momentum and narrative. Frame bets with clear success criteria, budgets, and stop rules. Launch scrappy pilots, broadcast learning, and promote owners who move first responsibly. Keep cycles short, celebrate progress, and make it safe to sunset losing ideas. Pair speed with lightweight risk caps and a simple escalation path. Your edge: energy that converts possibilities into adoption.",
  "Integrator": "Lead through alignment and boundaries. Facilitate kickoffs that clarify roles, decision rights, and interfaces. Install ritualsâ€”standups, demos, retrosâ€”that surface dissent and commitments. Map dependencies, negotiate SLAs across teams, and keep a shared roadmap visible. Set decision windows and escalation paths so harmony doesn't slow action. Your edge: durable collaboration that turns complexity into coordinated execution."
};

export const EXECUTION_STYLE_TEAM_MEMBER: JSONObject = {
  "Commander": "Contribute with ownership and speed. Take clear slices of scope, define â€˜done,â€™ and post daily signals so others can align. Unblock yourself quickly, escalate with options, and close loops in writing. Invite dissent before finalizing, and use lightweight checklists to keep quality high without slowing cadence.",
  "Architect": "Contribute through rigor and clarity. Write short specs, document interfaces, and keep runbooks current so teammates move confidently. Raise risks early with data, propose prototypes to test assumptions, and follow stage gates without ceremony. Protect quality by using checklists and peer review while keeping decisions timeboxed.",
  "Catalyst": "Contribute by creating momentum. Volunteer for ambiguous work, ship a scrappy v1, and broadcast learning so the team sees signal quickly. Recruit allies, keep cycles short, and manage exposure with budgets and stop rules. Turn wins into repeatable plays by codifying what worked after each iteration.",
  "Integrator": "Contribute by connecting dots. Translate between functions, map dependencies, and track agreements so handoffs are smooth. Surface dissent early and help the group decide within clear windows. Hold boundaries kindlyâ€”clarify ownership, document next steps, and follow through until commitments are closed."
